# Measure Pi

Measure Pi is a project for collecting and processing sensor data using a Raspberry Pi. The system is designed to interface with various sensors, collect measurements, and provide data logging or real-time monitoring capabilities. We also add multiple measure-stations based on the NodeMCU to our network for multiple rooms.

## Features

- Sensor data acquisition
- Data logging
- Real-time monitoring
- Modular and extensible design
